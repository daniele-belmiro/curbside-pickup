## Overview

This app allows shoppers and store staff to coordinate curbside pickup orders through email notifications. This improves the multi-channel experience and facilitates the pickup process by providing real-time interactions between store staff and shoppers. 

## Features

- Coordinates the curbside pickup process
- Sends emails to shopper and store staff in each stage of the curbside pickup process
- Adds comments in the order timeline as a curbside pickup order reaches each stage

## Setup

1. Install the app from the VTEX app store.

2. In your account's admin dashboard, go to `Apps > My Apps > Curbside Pickup` to configure the app settings:
- `App Key` & `App Token`: Generate a new app key/token pair in your VTEX account (or use an existing pair) and enter them here.

3. In your account's admin dashboard, go to `Inventory & shipping > Pickup points`. For each of your pickup point store locations, enter the store's email address in the **Address Line 2** field. The app will send store pickup notifications to this email address.

4. In your account's admin dashboard, go to `Curbside Pickup` (in the sidebar menu immediately below `Inventory & shipping`). In the box titled "Almost There", click the **PROCEED** button. This will initialize the order notification hook needed by the app and will create the following email templates:
- `curbside-ready-for-packing`: Sent to the store's email address (see step 3) when a curbside order is ready for handling.
- `curbside-package-ready`: Sent to the shopper when the order is ready to be picked up.
- `curbside-at-location`: Sent to the store's email address when the shopper has arrived at the pickup location.
⚠️ Once the email templates are created, you may customize them as you see fit. Follow the links to the templates from the Curbside Pickup page, or navigate to `Message center > Templates` from your admin dashboard sidebar.
